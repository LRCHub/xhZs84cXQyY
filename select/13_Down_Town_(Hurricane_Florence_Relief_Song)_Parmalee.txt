It's where I was born
Where I was raised
It's where I spent my yesterday's
Cotton rows, tobacco feels
That's where I felt how good country feels

My grandstand gave me my first job
Sweat'n in that July hot
He said, "If you follow through,
You're tried a true,
You'll learn a thing or two,
'Bout the people round here"

This ain't no going down town
When trouble comes around town
It's a proud of where you came from town
The kind of place where people stand their ground
No, this ain't no going down town

We've all weathered our fair share of storms
Ain't nothing we ain't seen before
We get hit, get knocked down
Get back up for another round
Round here, round here

This ain't no going down town
When trouble comes around town
It's a proud of where you came from town
The kind of place where people stand their ground
No, this ain't no going down town

5AM, get on up
Put a little gas in that coffee cup
Get your boots on, hop in the truck
'Cause what don't kill you gonna make you tough
Makin' end's meet anyway you can
Come sunday morning you thank the Man
For all the love, for all your friends
And that's why, man...

This ain't no going down town
When trouble comes around town
It's a proud of where you came from town
The kind of place where people stand their ground

No, this ain't no going down town
When trouble comes around town
It's a proud of where you came from town
The kind of place where people stand their ground
No, this ain't no going down town
No, this ain't no going down town
